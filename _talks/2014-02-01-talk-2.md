In this talk, I described various approaches to solve the task of Spoken dialect identification in a monolingual setup. These included using BNF, MFCC and the pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 for generating representations that capture various acoustic-phonetic characteristics and then analyse them using deep learning architectures such as time delay neural networks, BLSTMs, Transformers, etc.

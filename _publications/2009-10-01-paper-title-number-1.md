excerpt: 'The task of dialect identification (DID) is challenging due to high inter-class similarity. This becomes further complicated when we consider DID in a multilingual setup. This is because there will now be confusion between the dialects of closely related languages also. To solve this, we propose hierarchical classification. We propose a novel hierarchical classification loss to make use of the parent label.'

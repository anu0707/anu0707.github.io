title: "Exploring aggregated wav2vec 2.0 features for efficient spoken dialect identification"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2010-10-01-paper-title-number-2
excerpt: 'This paper explores the aggregation of representations from various layers of wav2vec 2.0 to obtain representations suitable for the task of spoken dialect identification. We explore different methods to aggregate the representations from all Transformer encoder layers. Specifically, statistical pooling and attentive statistical pooling based aggregation is used. We also use recently proposed DS-TDNN for obtaining the representations suitable for the task of dialect identification.'

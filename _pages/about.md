I am a final year MTech (By Research) student in Intelligent Systems at the School of Computing and Electrical Engineering, IIT Mandi. I have worked on "Spoken Dialect identification in monolingual and multilingual setup using deep learning based approaches". I have also worked as a Project Associate-I in the project titled "National Language Translation mission (NLTM): BHASHINI". I have 2 years and 6 months of research experience, where I have mainly used obtained features using pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 and bottle neck feature extractor to capture acoustic-phonetic characteristics along with deep learning based approaches such as TDNN, Transformers, BLSTMs to solve the challenging task of discriminating between the dialects of a language and different closely related languages.

My current research work revolved around using various deep learning based approaches for speech processing, but my passion for research pushes me to diversify my domain. The constant urge to challenge myself and learn new things drives me to do meaningful work helping society in general.

I am a final year MTech (By Research) student at IIT Mandi. I have worked on "Spoken Dialect identification in monolingual and multilingual setup using deep learning based approaches". I possess a strong passion for research. My curiosity and the urge to learn along with programming, analytical and technical skills makes me a good potential researcher who would be able to solve complex real-world problems, which could help the mankind in general.
